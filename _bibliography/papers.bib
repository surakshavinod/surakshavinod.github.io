  abstract  = {Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), a chronic metabolic disorder and the most
               common type of diabetes, is caused by reduced insulin secretion
               or insulin resistance in the body, leading to ineffective
               glucose uptake by the cells and eventually resulting in
               hyperglycemia. Metformin, sulfonylureas, and glitazones are the
               currently available commercial drugs used to treat T2D. These
               drugs either reduce the blood glucose level or elevate the
               insulin produced. However, the high cost, unavailability, and
               various side effects occurring from the use of these drugs have
               resulted in people looking for healthier and cost-effective ways
               to treat this disorder, including the use of plant extracts.
               This study highlights the alpha-amylase inhibition properties of
               Ocimum basilicum (basil) extracts through in vitro qualitative
               and quantitive inhibition assays. It also focuses on in silico
               approaches such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics
               simulation to determine the strength of the alpha-amylase
               inhibition. In vitro study revealed 1:20 diluted ethanolic,
               methanolic, and aqueous extracts of O. basilicum strongly
               inhibited salivary amylase. In silico analysis revealed Gamma
               Sitosterol, a compound present in relative abundance in O.
               basilicum, could be one of the phytocompounds responsible for
               this anti-diabetic property of O. basilicum. Thus, Gamma
               Sitosterol can be used as a potential therapeutic for T2D
               alongside other measures such as physical exercise and diet
               because the findings in this paper, although pertaining to human
               salivary amylase, can be extrapolated to human pancreatic
               amylase as salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase are known
               isoenzymes and share ~97\% sequence homology.},
